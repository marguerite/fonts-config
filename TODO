* 59-family-prefer-lang:
  + Google Noto CJK embeds Adobe Source Sans Pro as Latin.
    but Google wants us to use Roboto/Noto Sans for Latin.
    the CJK prepend needs to prepend Roboto/Noto Sans/Serif
    too ✓
  + Adobe Source Sans Pro is 2/3 of Noto Sans, need
    to resize with matrix ✓
  + Noto Sans CJK SC and Noto Sans SC are different font names
    (The later is a subset of the former). So we need to provide
    substitutes. ✓
  + Adobe Souce Han are the same as Google Noto CJK. we need
    to use Noto CJK to provide Source Han ✓
* openSUSE should support colored emojis out of the box.
  + "emoji" family has been defined by fontconfig. ✓
  + "Symbola" conflicts with color emoji. need to replace it
    completely ✓
  + "Dejavu" contains black and white and ugly emojis, need
    to strip the bad emojis from the font. or restrict Dejavu
    by chasets.
    (All fonts are recognized as sans-serif if not explicitly
     assigned, we can't prepend "emoji" to "sans-serif" (boo#1092737),
     so we have to make sure every font appeared before Noto
     Color Emoji are emoji-less)
  + Firefox embeded a "EmojiOne Mozilla" font, we need to reject
    it. ✓
  + Unset hint/antialias/autohint for emoji fonts. ✓
* openSUSE should use modern symbol fonts like Deepin OpenSymbol
  which is 100% replacement for M$ Wingdings and Symbola ✓
  + packaging of deepin-opensymbol-fonts ✓
  + fontconfig substitutions ✓
* Re-evaluate the selections in 60-family-prefer.conf
  especially the CJK part. Most of the fonts listed there are
  pretty old and have modern replacement.
* Evaluate Noto fonts and add them to TT/Non-TT Instucted
  Fonts ✓
* All fonts are 'sans-serif' by default, we need to remove Monospace
  ,Serif,Symbol fonts from the list. Emoji don't need to be removed,
  because webpages will not specify 'emoji' in font-family in the
  forseeable future.
* Downgrade weight for Noto Sans in CJK to match Source Sans Pro
